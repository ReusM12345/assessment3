My program function as a ferry booking system through it requisitionsystem class related structure. this is program which function as a ferry booking system creates a virtual booking process for our users to provide individual information collection along with ferry purchese documentation and total calculation and booking approval management. The ticket ID assignment begin with number 20001 according to the KISS principle for easy tracking through a direct and simple numbering and counting system. each method in the class demonstrates  to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by ensuring that it only performs one specific task get_customer_details() only collects personal information, record_ferry_items() handles the recording and calculation of purchased item prices, ferry_service_total() manages the approval decision logical operation and calculates an approval reference number, display_booking()  presents the booking details, and booking_statistic() provides list of system statistics such as total bookings, approvals, pending, and not approved counts. The program makes it clear how clean distinction of responsibilities within a class can improve the readability and maintainability of the code. The code implements clean code practices using basic print statements together with describeable variables and straightforward error handling methods for input function. designing simplifies programming structur as well as logic complexity to maintain clear understanding between users and developers.
