My program function as a ferry booking system through it requisitionsystem class related structure. this is program which function as a ferry booking system creates a virtual booking process for our users to provide individual information collection along with ferry purchese documentation and total calculation and booking approval management. The ticket ID assignment begin with number 20001 according to the KISS principle for easy tracking through a direct and simple numbering and counting system. each method in the class demonstrates  to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by ensuring that it only performs one specific task get_customer_details() only collects personal information, record_ferry_items() handles the recording and calculation of purchased item prices, ferry_service_total() manages the approval decision logical operation and calculates an approval reference number, display_booking()  presents the booking details, and booking_statistic() provides list of system statistics such as total bookings, approvals, pending, and not approved counts. The program makes it clear how clean distinction of responsibilities within a class can improve the readability and maintainability of the code. The code implements clean code practices using basic print statements together with describeable variables and straightforward error handling methods for input function. designing simplifies programming structur as well as logic complexity to maintain clear understanding between users and developers. There is a special feature of the approval reference number generation produces a unique entry by adding the passenger ID parts with ticket ID parts. this clear algorithm method tracks references by working independently as well. the straightforward implementation of the code comes from simple logic program which confirms the usage of the single responsibility and KISS principle. The system does not fulfill the DRY(Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle as I have repeated the calling of methods for adding the two attributes of two passengers. efficiency of the system can be benefited with further enhancment through the addition of subclasses that would enable more flexibility for dynamic system. I have added comment in the code end of the code shows no any inclusion to DRY principles because method calls for processing each passenger's detail without automation with the help of loops or functions or other methods to handle multiple passengers more efficiently. The maintenance level will decrease over time when developers duplicate code in the system as the number of users or passenger increase. The workflow should be converted into reusable code through a function design or by processing multiple passengers through data structures within a looping structure. As a basic programmer this program shows software developers how to utiliize object oriented programming for developing a simple booking system that is very easy to understand and maintain. The design provides beginners with basic principles to experience object-oriented development through straightforward language which minimizes the complexity.
